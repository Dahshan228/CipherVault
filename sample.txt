THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE—1776

IN CONGRESS, JULY 4, 1776 

The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united 
States of America 

WHEN in the Course of human events, it be
comes necessary for one people to dissolve the 
political bands which have connected them with 
another, and to assume among the powers of the 
earth, the separate and equal station to which 
the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle 
them, a decent respect to the opinions of man
kind requires that they should declare the 
causes which impel them to the separation.
